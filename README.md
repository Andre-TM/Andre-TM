- 👋 Hi, I’m @Andre-TM. I am a German/American and studied english and philosophy in Germany. I finally have my masters degree now!
- 👀 I’m interested in making a great Persona/Undertale-like story driven RPG in Game Maker 2. Story/Gamedesign is my strength.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Game Maker 2. Still have a lot of learning to do but I am coming a long fine so far.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my game! I could probably need help with adding things, like a dialog fighting system.
- 📫 How to reach me: Contract me on instagram @gurusam
